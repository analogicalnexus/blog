title: Outliers (Book Review) 
---

I feel misfits/outliers have something in common. In search of this pattern, I ended up with Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers. This post is more like personal notes than critics.(In progess)

1. 10,000 hours rule - Stories of Beatles, Bill Joy, and Bill Gates. Its interesting to know the rich billionaires from rail road and personal computer boom were born within nine years of one another. 
2. A basketball player has to be tall enough and the same is true of intelligence. Intelligence has a threshold.
3. Effects of a social class on pratical and analytical intelligence. The life stories of Robert Oppenheimer and Christopher Langan.  Unfortunately, less privileged people are bound to make their ways alone, and no one not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses ever makes it alone.
