title: Review of Graph based Neural Networks [In progress] 
---

Recently, a number of papers have been published in the area of graph based neural networks. In this post, I am going to summarize some of the papers . 

1. Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks	(Li et al.	2015)
2. The More You Know: Using Knowledge Graphs for Image Classification	(Marino et al.	2016)
3. Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering	(Teney et al.	2016)
4. Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks	(Kipf and Welling	2016)
5. Structural-RNN: Deep Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs	(Jain et al.	2015)
