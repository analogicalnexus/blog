title: Review of Graph based Neural Networks [In progress] 
---

Recently, a number of papers have been published in the area of graph based neural networks. In this post, I am going to summarize some of the papers . 

1. The Graph Neural Network Model (Scarselli et al. 2009)
2. Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks	(Li et al.	2015)
3. The More You Know: Using Knowledge Graphs for Image Classification	(Marino et al.	2016)
4. Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering	(Teney et al.	2016)
5. Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks	(Kipf and Welling	2016)
6. Structural-RNN: Deep Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs	(Jain et al.	2015)
