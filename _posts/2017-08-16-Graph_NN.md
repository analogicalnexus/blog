Recently, a number of papers have been published in the area of graph based neural networks. In this post, I am going to summarize some of the papers . 


### The More You Know: Using Knowledge Graphs for Image Classification	Marino et al.	2016
### Graph-Structured Representations for Visual Question Answering	Teney et al.	2016
### Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks	Kipf and Welling	2016
### Structural-RNN: Deep Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs	Jain et al.	2015
### Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks	Li et al.	2015
### Recurrent Neural Networks for Driver Activity Anticipation via Sensory-Fusion Architecture	Jain et al.	2015
